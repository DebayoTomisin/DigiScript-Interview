I mean looking back on this, i honestly feel this was a complete overkill using context and all the file complexities, but there were certain hooks i wanted to test out. for example, localstorage reducer, which replaces the regular local storage in js. It was a challenging project to be honest, I didn't think a todo app would be this difficult.

The stack used in building this:
1. React
2. Font Awesome CDN
3. material ui as well

To run the application
1. clone the repo
2. enter the commandline of the project folder and run npm install
3. npm start to start the dev server.
